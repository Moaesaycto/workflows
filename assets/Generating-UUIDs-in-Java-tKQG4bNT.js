const n=`# Generating UUIDs in Java\r
\r
To generate a UUID in java, begin by importing \`java.util.UUID\`, which should be built in.\r
\r
Then, you can generate it by taking:\r
\r
\`\`\`java\r
UUID uuid = UUID.randomUUID();\r
uuid.toString(); // This gets the actual thing as a string\r
\`\`\``;export{n as default};
