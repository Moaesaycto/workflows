const n="# The Annihilator Method\r\n\r\nIf $f(x)$ is differentiable at least $n$ times and\r\n\r\n$$\r\n    \\left[\\sum_{j = 0}^n a_jD^j\\right]f(x) = 0,\r\n$$\r\n\r\nthen we say\r\n\r\n$$\r\n    \\left[\\sum_{j = 0}^n a_jD^j\\right]\r\n$$\r\n\r\n**annihilates** $f$.\r\n\r\nSome notable examples include the fact that $D^n$ annihilates $x^{m-1}$ for $m \\leq n$ and $(D-\\alpha)^n$ annihilates $x^{m-1}e^{\\alpha x}$ for $m \\leq n$.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Example Questions\r\n\r\n**Homogeneous DE Example Question:** Let $Lu = u'-u$ such that $Lu = x^2.$ By annihilating both sides,\r\n\r\n$$\r\n    D^3(u'-u) = u'''' - u''' = 0.\r\n$$\r\n\r\nSetting $w = u''',$ clearly $w = Ce^x$ is the general solution. Integrating three times yields\r\n\r\n$$\r\n    u = Ce^x + Ex^2 + Fx + G.\r\n$$\r\n\r\nIt is clear that $u_h = Ae^x$ and the form of the particular solution is $u_p = Ex^2 + Fx + G.$ By substituting into the original equation and comparing coefficients, we will arrive at\r\n\r\n$$\r\n    E = -1, \\quad F = 2, \\quad G = 1.\r\n$$\r\n\r\n**Further Example Question:** Let $Lu = u'' - u'$ such that $Lu = x^2.$ We will first note that $p(0) \\neq 0$ for $L = p(D)$ so we are not yet able to solve this. Annihilating both sides, we get\r\n\r\n$$\r\n    D^3(u'' -u') = u^{(5)} - u^{(4)} = 0.\r\n$$\r\n\r\nSetting $w = u^{(4)},$ $w = Ce^x$ is the general solution. Again, integrating four times yields\r\n\r\n$$\r\n    u = Ce^x + Ex^3 + Fx^2 + Gx + H.\r\n$$\r\n\r\nHere, $u_h = Ae^x + H$ is the **homogeneous** solution and the particular solution is\r\n\r\n$$\r\n    u_p = x(Ex^2 + Fx + G).\r\n$$\r\n\r\nWe can use substitution again to find that\r\n\r\n$$\r\n    E = -\\frac{1}{3}, \\quad F = -1, \\quad G = -2.\r\n$$\r\n\r\n**Example when $p(\\mu) = 0$:** Let $Lu = u' - u$ such that $Lu = e^x.$ We again note that $\\mu = 1$ and $p(\\mu) = 0$ for $L = p(D)$ so we are not able to solve this immediately. We may annihilate both sides by\r\n\r\n$$\r\n    (D-1)(u'-u) = u'' - 2u' + u = 0.\r\n$$\r\n\r\nThe characteristic polynomial has a repeated root, so\r\n\r\n$$\r\n    u = Ae^x + Bxe^x\r\n$$\r\n\r\nwill be the general solution. So here, $u_h = Ae^x$ is the homogeneous solution and so the particular solution is\r\n\r\n$$\r\n    u_p = Bxe^x.\r\n$$\r\n\r\nSubstituting, we find that\r\n\r\n$$\r\n    B = 1.\r\n$$";export{n as default};
